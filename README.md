# Industry Project for FoodPanda
## Healthy Food Ordering

Project brief:
Show an alert in the cart when adding items which are not meeting with the user's predefined health conditions.

This will require being able to enter their preferences etc. in the application; as well as
storing or deriving the relevant data for menu items.

This idea can be combined with encouraging users to do self pick-up of their orders from the
restaurants by presenting the user with how many calories they would burn if they were to
walk to/from the restaurant using geo-data.
